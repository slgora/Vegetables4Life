- Results and figures produced by the analyses.

## Folders
- Data Processing/  
  Scripts to extract and compile data, and to standardize taxonomy to the World Flora Online (WFO), producing occurrence datasets and vegetable species lists.
- Occ_maps/  
  Scripts to map occurrence richness and species richness at 10 km, 20 km, and 50 km resolutions. Includes resampling scripts using the spThin package, a script that applies a 50 km circular neighborhood, and a script that creates a zoomed map for Latin America.
